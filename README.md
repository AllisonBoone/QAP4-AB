One Stop Insurance claims program.

The program allows users to input customer information to make insurance claims(s) on their vehicle(s).

First, you run the program and it will prompt you to enter relivant data for making to claim. Once you enter all the 
information it will print a receipt for the user, showing a break down of all the costs and what the customer is 
expected to pay. Once the receipt is printed the user will be asked if they want to make another claim, in which case 
they can say yes, which will allow them to make another claim, or no, which will exit them out of the program.
